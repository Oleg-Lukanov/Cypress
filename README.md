# Cypress Testing Project

## Summary of Repo

This repository contains Cypress end-to-end tests for the [Conduit](https://conduit.realworld.how) application. The tests cover user registration, login, article creation, and various screen resolutions to ensure responsive design. The project is set up to run tests automatically in a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and to generate reports using the Cypress Dashboard.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (version 6 or higher)
- GitHub account with a repository to run CI/CD pipeline
- Cypress account for the Dashboard (to obtain the Cypress record key)

## Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Steps to Launch

### Running Cypress Tests Locally

1. **Open Cypress Test Runner**

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:open
   ```

   This command will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to run tests interactively.

2. **Run Cypress Tests with Different Configurations**

   You can run tests for different screen resolutions using the following commands:

   - **Desktop Tests**

     ```bash
     npm run cypress:run:desktop
     ```

   - **Tablet Tests**

     ```bash
     npm run cypress:run:tablet
     ```

   - **Mobile Tests**

     ```bash
     npm run cypress:run:mobile
     ```

### Running Cypress Tests in CI/CD Pipeline

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**

   The repository is configured to run Cypress tests in a GitHub Actions pipeline. The workflow file (`.github/workflows/cypress.yml`) includes steps to run tests for different screen resolutions.

2. **Add Cypress Record Key**

   To record test results on the Cypress Dashboard, add your Cypress record key to your GitHub repository secrets:

   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on `Settings`.
   - Click on `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
   - Click `New repository secret`.
   - Add `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` as the name and your Cypress record key as the value.

## Steps to Creating the Report

1. **Generate Cypress Dashboard Report**

   The Cypress Dashboard allows you to record and view test results. Ensure your tests are set to record by including the `--record` flag and your Cypress record key:

   ```bash
   npm run cypress:run:desktop -- --record --key $CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY
   npm run cypress:run:tablet -- --record --key $CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY
   npm run cypress:run:mobile -- --record --key $CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY
   ```

2. **View the Report on Cypress Dashboard**

   After the tests run, you can view the detailed report on the Cypress Dashboard:

   - Go to the Cypress Dashboard (https://dashboard.cypress.io/).
   - Log in with your Cypress account.
   - Navigate to your project to see the test run results, including video recordings, screenshots, and logs.

## GitHub Actions Workflow File

Here's the GitHub Actions workflow file to run Cypress tests with different configurations:

```yaml
name: Cypress Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  cypress-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        config: [desktop, tablet, mobile]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Cypress Tests
      env:
        CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
      run: npm run cypress:run:${{ matrix.config }} -- --record --key $CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY
```

By following these steps, you will have a comprehensive setup for running Cypress tests locally and in a CI/CD pipeline, along with generating detailed reports on the Cypress Dashboard.
